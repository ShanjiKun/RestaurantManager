Don’t Search for Art, We Will Recommend It To You 
Using Artificial Intelligence, we built an “Art Recommendation Engine” which will recommend artworks based on your taste and preferences. We kept it super simple. Once you open the app you will see your “Art Stream”. In this stream you can indicate per artwork if you like it or not by swiping left or right. The more you swipe the better we learn your art taste and we will recommend artworks that match your taste on the fly! 

Stream Art To Your TV
We have a unique feature that allows you to change your TV into a digital canvas! You can stream every artwork in high res to your TV using Chromecast or Apple TV.
